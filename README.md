TASK                                                                                                                        
Develop an AI/ML project to recognize emotions through speech. Use a
dataset containing audio recordings labeled with various emotions.
Extract features such as pitch, tone, and intensity using libraries like
Librosa. Train a machine learning model, such as an SVM or neural
network, to classify the emotions based on these features. Evaluate the
model's accuracy and fine-tune it for better performance. This project
demonstrates skills in audio processing, feature extraction, and machine
learning, providing insights into human emotional states through speech
analysis.
